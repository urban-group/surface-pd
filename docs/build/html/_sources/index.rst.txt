Welcome to surface-pd's documentation!
======================================
The Surface Phase Diagram Generator (**surface-pd**, **the abbreviation**)is an
open-source Python package designed to automate the surface reconstruction
enumeration and plotting surface phase diagram.

This program uses the density functional theory (DFT) energies
to calculate the surface free energy of each reconstruction. It can be
directly used to do surface enumeration for catalysts,
electrodes, and metals
surfaces as well as corrosion on the surfaces.
